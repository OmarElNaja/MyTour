# MyTour
MyTour is a Geographic Information System (GIS) software program that queries an OpenStreetMap database to allow tourists to visualize and solve travel and optimization problems in maps of any city of the world. It is able to

- Read in a database of all the intersections and streets and other geographic features in a city and organize it into appropriate data structures.
- Draw the resulting map nicely and let the user interact (pan, zoom, highlight, search for locations, etc.) with it.
- Find good travel routes between intersections in the city and give directions to a user.
- Find a good order of deliveries and a good driving path for a courier company driver to complete
his/her list of daily deliveries.
