# MyTour
MyTour is a Geographic Information System (GIS) software program that allows tourists to visualize and solve travel and optimization problems in maps of any city of the world. It is able to

- Read in a database of all the intersections and streets and other geographic features in a city and organize it into appropriate data structures.
- Draw the resulting map nicely and let the user interact (pan, zoom, highlight, search for locations, etc.) with it.
- Find good travel routes between intersections in the city and give directions to a user.
- Find a good order of deliveries and a good driving path for a courier company driver to complete
his/her list of daily deliveries.
